WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
SONNET 18: SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER’S DA8?
IT HAS A CLEAR SONNET FORM AND IS ONL8 14 LINES LONG.


SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER’S DA8?
THOU ART MORE LOVEL8 AND MORE TEMPERATE:
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MA8,
AND SUMMER’S LEASE HATH ALL TOO SHORT A DATE;
SOMETIME TOO HOT THE E8E OF HEAVEN SHINES,
AND OFTEN IS HIS GOLD COMPLE7ION DIMM'D;
AND EVER8 FAIR FROM FAIR SOMETIME DECLINES,
B8 CHANCE OR NATURE’S CHANGING COURSE UNTRIMM'D;
BUT TH8 ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE,
NOR LOSE POSSESSION OF THAT FAIR THOU OW’ST;
NOR SHALL DEATH BRAG THOU WANDER’ST IN HIS SHADE,
WHEN IN ETERNAL LINES TO TIME THOU GROW’ST:
SO LONG AS MEN CAN BREATHE OR E8ES CAN SEE,
SO LONG LIVES THIS, AND THIS GIVES LIFE TO THEE.
